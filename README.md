# Master's Brew

## Purposes

The goal of this application is to provide a hassle-free
experience for table-top RPG players to manage their characters.
At the moment, the program focusses on the fifth edition of *Dungeons and Dragons*,
however in future we would like to add functionality for other major tabletop games,
or the ability for users to effectively template their own character sheets for whatever
tabletop games they wish to play.

My reason for creating this project resulted from my own frustrations in dealing with other
free tabletop RPG character sheet management software, which often feels incredibly clunky or limiting
in what you can actually do in it. It is my hope that in solving these issues for myself, other people
might find use in this project as well.
